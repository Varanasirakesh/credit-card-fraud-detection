# credit-card-fraud-detection
A overview of this task 

-->A dataset with 23 features was used also feature engineering and pre-processing
   techniques like dropping duplicates, merging the columns were performed.

-->Addressed class imbalance using Random Oversampling, SMOTE and ADASYN technique

-->Employed hyper parameter tuning to optimize model performance, identifying top 10
   impactful features on the basis of rank 1 features other than rank 1 were dropped.

-->Implemented Logistic Regression, XGBoost, Decision Tree and Random Forest, XGBoost
   ADASYN yielding the best results

-->Conducted cost benefit analysis by implementing the XGBoost ADASYN model.
